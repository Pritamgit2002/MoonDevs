# Task-Fragmentation
#### AN assignment to test the fragmentation ability of Developers
#### My Pick - Fragmentation of Functinality / UI [also, fragment two hooks]
## My Reasons for Fragmentating it like that
#### I have two components name BurnButtonBarContent.tsx and BurnStatsContainerContent.tsx<br><br>

## These are the two major components that is serving different purpose
#### BurnButtonBarContent : It's taking the number to burn token and showing the results.
#### BurnStatsContainerContent : It's showing statistics and visualization of tokens according to the address based on the supply chain ID and token type.<br><br>

## also, made Two custom Hooks as It is simple to two understand that It will increase the readibility of the code also It will perfectly describe their functions.
#### useBurnTransactions.ts : fetching the data of burned transaction.
#### useCoinData.ts : fetching coin data from CoinGeckoApi.
